1.  ##### What is a compound assignment operator? How does it work?

- *•	Used to shorted code, works the same as if they were split.*
---
2.  ##### List all the compound assignment operators.
- *•	*=, /=, %=, +=,-=*
---
3.  ##### List two ways to increment a numeric variable by 5. List two ways to decrement a numeric variable by 50.
- *•	Count += 1;
•	Count++;*
---
4.  ##### How long does a while loop run?
- *As long as it is true*
---
5.  ##### What is an iteration variable? (Not in book)
- *Before each loop end it will produce a value.*
---
6.  ##### What happens if you don’t change the loop variable in the body of the while loop block?
- *•	It will repeat forever.*
---
7.  ##### How many parts does a for loop statement have? Can you omit any of them? Can you omit all of them? What happens if you omit all of them?
- *It has three parts the initialization, Boolean expression, the code that updates the control variable  •	You can omit each part to get a different result or error. P-122/123*
---
8.  ##### How do you guarantee that a loop runs at least once?
- *Use the Do statement*
---
9.  ##### What does the break statement do?
- *Used to jump out of the body of an iteration.*
---
10. ##### What does the continue statement do?
- *Is caused to preform the next iteration in the loop.*
---
11. ##### 11.	(Thought question) Can you think of any reason why you would want to have an infinite loop? An “infinite loop” is a loop without an update variable that in effect runs forever. As you will see, these kinds of loops are written intentionally to perform various kinds of tasks.
