1.  ##### What is a parameter array?
- *you can pass a variable number of arguments to a method.*

2.  ##### How do you define a method that takes an arbitrary number of arguments?
- *public static int Min(params int[] paramList)*
---
3.  ##### How do you call a method that takes an arbitrary number of arguments?
- *UseParams2(,1,2,3,4,5,6);*
---
4.  ##### Why canâ€™t you use an array to pass an arbitrary number of arguments to a method?
- *likely it has a fixed amount in memory.*
---
5.  ##### How many parameters can a method have?
- *any number.*
---
6.  ##### Do parameter arguments have to have the same type?
- *no.*
---
7.  ##### What is the difference between a method that takes a parameter argument and one that takes optional arguments?
- *optional is it has a fixed amount, params can have a lot of different.*
---
8.  ##### How do you define a method that takes different (and arbitrary) types of arguments?
- *use params key word.*
---
9.  ##### Write a method that accepts any number of arguments of a given type.
- *someType Method(params bool[] flags).*
---
10. ##### Write a method that accepts any number of arguments of any type.
- *meType Method(params object[] paramList).*
